# Everybody's TRash
Waste reduction site that allows users to tag salvagable trash they find on the street, so other users can come pick it up.

Everybody's Trash runs on a Rails api backend w a React frontend.  Mapbox was used to incorporate an interctive street map that allows users to tag salvagable trash, and list trash by ascending distance from the user.  There is also a chat feature so that users can organize pick up of larger items that may not be on the street.  The chat feature uses actioncable to establish web socket connections for real time chat and notifications.
